# RC-Arduino-Car

Materials Used:
  - Arduino Uno
  - Adafruit Motor Shield
  - 9 volt battery and 4 AA batteries
  - HC-05 bluetooth module
  - Frame and electric motors

This was my first arduino project. It took about 4-6 hours to finish. The biggest issue that I ran into was soldering. I soldered the motors and the shield poorly causing faulty connections and tons of shorts. Thankfully I was able to fix the issues. Other than that it is a very easy build. The frame and electric motors where bought from amazon and made it really convinient to build. The HC-05 was used to control the car with a phone app. The app worked well, there was not much delay present. The final product was quite impressive while not that fast it was pretty capable. It was able to go through my garden, up my windshield in my car, through grass and up my roof. The car did take damage during this but I was impressed. Improvements that could be done include adding a swicth to it. At the moment the batteries must be disconnected to turn the car off. Also better motors could be added to the car. Laslty while the amazon frame was nice and easy, it is very heavy and bulky. Usign a smaller and lighter frame could for sure make it a much better rc car.
